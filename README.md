# webathon-portfolio
            A personal portfolio made during the webathon! (3 days lol)
                                                   
Tech Stack Used: HTML,CSS,Javascript.

The personal portfolio includes everything about me and the services I provide as a part time freelancer.

Features:
1. The navigation bar has got a custom theme-changing tool (can be changed by the user). It's got 4 different fonts but 
by default it has been set to font-size 3 with default color to red. The user can change it as per his/her needs, but once
refreshed the values will be back to their default values. 

2. First time implemented a style tag in HTML file for small purposes such as the progress bar in About Me section. The resume
has also been added, which upon clicked opens in a new tab.

3. Whenever you hover through the "Things I love doing" section, the three tabs are uplifted. This is something very common, 
but was my first try in this project. 

4. In the "Portfolio" section, the projects have been separated using the attribute "data-filter" so that they can be filtered 
as per their domains. Also Javascript has been added to support the functions.



Issues I ran into: 
1. Not being able to add a photo above my name. For some reason, the CSS properties couldn't be applied, and if done then they
went out of scope. 

2. Creating a rotating "Operations+Work Experience" tab, so I could add more. The Javascript function for the code had some bugs, so
had to scrape it off. 



Clickable Buttons that open into new tabs:
1. Resume 
2. Portfolio section which showcases my projects. Click on the 3 dots when you hover above the image.
3. The "Click Here" button in "Top-Projects" section. 


PS: Dummy photos have been taken for the Webathon. And there has been a constant use of arrow functions for better understanding of the project.

My recommendation is using the Dark Mode, font-size 3 and red color for the best effects!


Honestly, developing the portfolio in a matter of just 3 days unveiled a new sense of motivation in me, it was surely tiring but totally worth it!
