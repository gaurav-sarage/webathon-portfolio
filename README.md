# webathon-portfolio
A personal portfolio made during the webathon! (3 days lol)

The personal portfolio includes everything about me and the services I provide as a part time freelancer.

The navigation bar has got a custom theme-changing tool (can be changed by the user). It's got 4 different fonts but 
by default it has been set to font-size 3 with default color to red. The user can change it as per his/her needs, but once
refreshed the values will be back to their default values.
